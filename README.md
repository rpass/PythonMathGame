# MathGame
#### _me make a thing_
MathGame is a command-line game being built as a two-headed exercise. The first is in Python OO development, the second is in practicing basic arithmetic. 

#### to play
Download the source, navigate to directory and run
```python3 MathGame.py```

#### to stop playing
Remember your loved ones. This is just a game. Addiction is real. Press ```Ctrl+C``` or wait for your turn to expire and the game to end.

#### to contribute
Please contribute, this is an exercise in software development and considering other points of view is a part of that. Open an issue on Github or just shout at me loud enough for me to hear. Maybe you can do a pull request, I'm not sure though.
